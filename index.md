# Welcome

I am a PhD student in the CS department (since Sep 2016) at the Intelligent Visual Interfaces lab in Rutgers University 
working on Multi-modal A.I., under the supervision of Dr. Mubbasir Kapadia and Dr. Gerard De Melo. Particularly, I work 
on joint understanding of images/videos with abstract and narrative text with applications to story illustration, 
visual storytelling, image captioning and image retrieval. I previously worked on authenticating multimedia content 
such as videos and images using passive image analysis techniques and Machine Learning.
